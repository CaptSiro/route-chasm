# RouteChasm

Successor of RoutePass, a PHP MVC Framework

Documentation coming soon. 

In the meantime check out `index.php` for routing examples, `src/tables` for database abstraction ([underlying customized library](https://github.com/CaptSiro/oakbase)), and `src/components` for rendering views.

This library is still in heavy development and all features are subject to change.
